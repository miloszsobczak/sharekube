# ShareKube Project Assistant

## Project Overview
- ShareKube is a Kubernetes extension that creates temporary preview environments by copying resources between namespaces
- Primary Languages: Go (operator), TypeScript (documentation)
- Structure: Monorepo with apps/ and packages/ directories

## Coding Standards
- Go code:
  - Use tabs for indentation
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Compliance with Kubernetes controller patterns
  - Proper API comments
  - Unit tests for new functionality

- TypeScript/JavaScript code:
  - Use 2-space indentation
  - Follow React/Docusaurus best practices

## Key Components
- Operator: Kubernetes controller managing resource copying
- API: ShareKube CRD definitions
- Documentation: Docusaurus-based site

## Critical Guidelines
- Ensure compatibility with Kubernetes patterns
- Validate resource definitions against Kubernetes API standards
- Consider security implications of resource copying
- Follow reconciliation patterns for controller logic
- Maintain backward compatibility in API changes

## Code Language Policy
- ALL code, comments, documentation, variable names, and commit messages MUST be written in English
- This applies even if chat conversations are in another language
- Maintain consistent English terminology throughout the codebase

## Priorities
1. Clear error handling and recovery
2. Resource synchronization performance
3. Security of cross-namespace operations
4. Documentation clarity for users
